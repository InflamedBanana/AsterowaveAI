# AsterowaveAI
An attempt at making an AI for a jam game, using Unity ML-Agents

The original game can be downloaded [here](https://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/asterowave)

I stripped all unnecessary or too complicated features like bonuses etc, to make it simpler at first.

The ML-agents library isn't included in the repository.
